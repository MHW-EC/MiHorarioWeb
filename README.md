# Mi Horario Web! (MHW)

This project was built with React for the frontend and Express for the backend, as database we used MongoDB. 

## What's is MHW?

It is a page that allows you to generate schedules in a simple way without classes or exams clashing in their schedules. At the end you can visualize the different timetable options, each one has a table where you can see the list of teachers and the parallel of the course, plus a button to see the schedule of classes, partial exams, final and improvement in a weekly calendar.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs de server of backend, this is necessary for the page to work, because it opens the connection to the database. This server use as static the bundle generated by `ǹpm run build` located in build folder.<br />
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run dev`

Runs the page in development mode. The page will reload if you make edits (changes in front code).<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
